LinkedIn Job Postings Analysis

NOTE: The .csv data used for the analysis could not be uploaded due to its large size. For access to the data, please reach out directly.

Project Overview
This project dives into a dataset of LinkedIn job postings, aiming to discern employment trends and insights. It examines company details, job titles, descriptions, and salary ranges to provide a comprehensive view of the job market landscape.

Dataset Description
The compiled dataset contains key job-related information from LinkedIn postings, encompassing:
- Company information
- Job titles
- Descriptions
- Salary information

Data Cleaning Process
- Elimination of rows lacking company names and job descriptions.
- Creation of a binary indicator for absent domain field values.
- Data type verification and correction.
- Outlier management for salary and follower counts at the 95th percentile.
- Special character removal from job descriptions.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Implementation of descriptive statistics for insights into company sizes, salary ranges, and job posting frequency.
- Correlation and categorical analyses to understand prevalent titles, hiring patterns, and experience level distributions.

Feature Engineering
- Salary classification into 'Low', 'Medium', and 'High' brackets.
- Application of label and frequency encoding methods to categorical data.

Predictive Modeling
- Deployment of a Random Forest Classifier to predict salary categories with substantial accuracy.
- Construction of a Logistic Regression model for comparative analysis.

Data Visualization
- Creation of visual representations for the distribution of salary ranges and the frequency of job postings by company.
- Geographic analysis of job posting distribution across various locations.

Conclusions and Recommendations
- The study provides valuable insights into LinkedIn's job market dynamics.
- Suggestions for model improvement and potential biases are discussed.

Future Work
- Predictive model enhancements.
- In-depth textual analysis of job descriptions.
- Regular incorporation of new data for ongoing analysis.

Technologies Used
- Python programming.
- Data analysis and machine learning with libraries including Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn.

How to Use
1. Ensure installation of Python and required packages: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn.
2. Use Pandas for data loading and manipulation.
3. Follow the Jupyter Notebooks to replicate the EDA and modeling processes.
